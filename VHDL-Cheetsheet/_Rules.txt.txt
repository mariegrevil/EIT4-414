VHDL RULES:

	- Variables are local to the declared process (fill with: := )

		- Variables update instantly


	- Signals are global variables (Fill with: <= )

		- Signals update only on system wait, and only updates their last command


	- Process sensitivity lists will always check for changes to the input signals

	- Red waves in signal waveform means error

	- DOWNTO is the preferred way of filling a vector i VHDL

	- Vector values can not be used for calculations because their values is not percived as numbers, Instead use unsigned 

	- Multiplying by 2(the base in binary) using bit shift, uses almost no resources.

	- The convention when writing a process with a "wait on" or variable dependent process, is to write it as a assignment
	outside of a process (when not writing for the industry). The assignment will automaticly "wait on" or be dependent onchanges 
	to the variables to the right of the = sign in the assignment.

	- The standard way of making a multiplexer (MUX) is to use a "case - when" statement (switch case in C).
